<p>We accept only Bitcoins as deposit option. If you want to know more -

<p>We have generated address for all your transactions. Any money sent to this 
address will be deposited to your account. Please note, that we wait until we 
get at least one confirmation of the transaction, so it will take some time for 
sent bitcoins to appear here. This delay depends on network size and load at 
this moment.</p>

<p><strong>You need to come back to this page when you will see confirmations of your
transaction in order to finalize depositing of Bitcoins.</strong></p>
